need contributions from community members just like you!

# How to contact this project.

The word Casa comes from the Spanish word for "home". Project CasaOS originated as a pre-installed system for
crowdfunded product [ZimaBoard](https://www.zimaboard.com) on Kickstarter.

After looking at many systems and software on the market, the team found no server system designed for home scenarios,
sadly true.

So, we set out to build this open source project to develop CasaOS with our own hands, everyone in the community, and
you.

We believes that through community-driven collaborative innovation and open communication with global developers, we can
reshape the digital home experience like never before.
